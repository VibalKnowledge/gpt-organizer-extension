## Technical Details

### Architecture

The extension uses a content script that injects directly into ChatGPT's sidebar, providing a native feel without popup windows.

### Permissions

- `storage`: Save folder structure and GPT assignments
- `activeTab`: Interact with ChatGPT pages
- `host_permissions`: Access to ChatGPT domains for sidebar integration

### Storage & Data Persistence

**Enhanced Storage System:**
- Primary: Chrome sync storage for cross-device synchronization
- Backup: Chrome local storage as fallback
- Error handling prevents data loss during storage failures
- Debounced saving prevents excessive storage operations

**Data Stored:**
- Folder structure with names and colors
- GPT assignments to folders
- Recent GPTs history
- User preferences (theme, collapsed states)

### GPT Detection

The extension automatically detects custom GPTs by:
- Monitoring URL patterns (`/g/g-[id]`)
- Extracting GPT names from page titles and headings
- Filtering out generic "ChatGPT" entries
- Tracking recently visited custom GPTs

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Chrome browser with Developer mode enabled
- Knowledge of JavaScript ES6+, HTML5, and CSS3
- Familiarity with Chrome Extension APIs

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Make changes to source files
3. Reload extension in `chrome://extensions/`
4. Test on ChatGPT pages with custom GPTs

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Appearing

1. Ensure you're on a ChatGPT page with a custom GPT
2. Refresh the page and wait a moment for injection
3. Check extension is enabled in `chrome://extensions/`

### GPTs Not Being Detected

1. Make sure you're logged into ChatGPT
2. Navigate to actual custom GPTs (URLs with `/g/g-`)
3. Generic ChatGPT conversations won't show the current GPT section
4. Try visiting the GPT store and opening a custom GPT

### Data Not Saving

1. Check browser console for "GPT Organizer" error messages
2. Verify storage permissions in extension settings
3. Try creating a test folder to verify storage works
4. Extension automatically falls back to local storage if sync fails

### Right-Click Menu Not Working

1. Ensure you're right-clicking directly on GPT items
2. Try refreshing the page if context menus don't appear
3. Check that no other extensions are interfering with right-click
